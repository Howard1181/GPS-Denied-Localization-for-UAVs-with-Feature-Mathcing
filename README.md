# Non-GPS UAV Localization with Feature Matching
This repository showcases a C++ module for UAV localization algorithms using Feature Matchiing.
It is designed to demonstrate technical expertise in real-time system communication, UAV modeling, and image-based positioning. The code is tailored for demonstration and evaluation purposes, and not intended for direct commercial use.

## Overview
This project simulates a real-time communication loop between a UAV system and a visual localization unit - a typical architecture in robotics, autonomous systems, and embedded perception.
